This game is so bug-ridden, I'm starting to think that there are even more bugs than Pokemon. So I've decided to catch 'em all. I'm collecting all the glitches I find here. PM me your glitches if you want to see them showcased.

## Communicating through a portal

## Card disappearance

## RotA showing up as MF

This is here for documentation purposes, but you can't tell this from a screenshot so there's little point in showing one. The point is: sometimes a card shows up as a different one, even in the logs.

## A spectator's sleeves showing up as mine

Again for documentation purposes. Unfortunately, the image got set to 403. Please send me a screenshot of this if you encounter it.

## Heavy Storm in the Extra Deck

(Of course, I cannot prove to you that these weren't unlimited games, you'll have to take my word for it.)

## Cards not corresponding with their images in the log

## 5x Droll & Lock Bird in hand

## Text becoming bold and underlined

## Mirrorred game vs. ghost user

![](https://i.imgur.com/N2NPWZC.png)

I got this by entering a challenge, clicking on a name from the user list, and then clicking "View profile" right at the moment they accept my challenge. It seems to give you a preview of the admin panel. There are buttons for viewing the main chat history, making either player lose the game, and cancelling the call. None of the buttons worked, though.

## Sending a card from the GY to the GY

Look at the log on the left. When this happens, you hear the sound of a card being sent elsewhere, but everything is still in place. So you'll be really paranoid about what they moved. Really confusing.

## Black cards

## Huge-ass menus

When you get this, the menu disappears as soon as you try to select something. The glitch also seems to stay even if you start another duel with another deck.

## Sample message as soon as the game starts

## Messed up login screen

## Weird tokens

## Duel note doesn't appear for other players

Look at my game in the following screenshot. It includes the note "Yugi Kaiba PM me".

But for others it doesn't.

## Card hovering over the phase buttons

My opponent set a monster, and it appeared like this for me (but not for themselves). When their turn started, it would hover over the next phase button, cycling through all of them.

# The bottom line

*There once was a man named Xteven*

*Who had an idea and went a-conceivin'*

*He made a promising fork*

*Of Dueling Network*

*But the glitches and lag left us grievin'.*
